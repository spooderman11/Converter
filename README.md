## Image/Video to GIF Converter

A Python script that converts image or video files into GIF format using the `imageio` package.

Features:
- Supports conversion of both image and video files to GIF.
- Utilizes the `imageio` library for efficient and reliable file handling.
- User-friendly interface with clear prompts and instructions.
- Progress indication during the conversion process.
- Provides the path to the generated GIF file for easy access.

Potential Flaws:
- Dependencies: Requires the `imageio` package to be installed.
- Installation Prompt: May interrupt the user experience with installation prompts if the required package is missing.
- Limited Error Handling: The script relies on default error handling, which may not provide detailed error messages in case of failures.
- Command Line Interface: Does not have a graphical user interface (GUI) and operates through the command line interface (CLI), which may not be as user-friendly for some individuals.
- Lack of Customization Options: Does not offer advanced customization options for GIF creation, such as frame rate adjustment or image/video editing.

### Please note that it's important to obtain proper authorization and comply with copyright laws when working with images or videos.
